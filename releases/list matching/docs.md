# Breakdown:

*Identify tokens tickers using a predefined list; accurate results.*

Manually exporting telegram chat history and then processing it using beautifulsoup and regex. Use a predefined list(coingecko or uniswap tokens list for example)
to isolate tokens tickers

To improve: 
Getting live data instead of manually exporting chat history.

Get token lists as files from  a server which will generate them each hour. This will reduce running time.

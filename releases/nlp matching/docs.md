# Breakdown:

*Identify tokens tickers using AI, ideal for finding upcoming projects.*

Manually exporting telegram chat history and then processing it using beautifulsoup and regex. Use spacy named entities recognization to isolate tokens tickers

To improve: Getting live data instead of manually exporting chat history Build a custom filter or train a model to recognize tokens tickers
